# Brief (About the Project)
This project is very much a work-in-progress for me to learn more about deep neural networks (in particular, computer vision and ConvNet). It's not intended for official use anywhere. 

In addition, the code will be updated irregularly, and may not be updated often. There are ideas for expandability included in the main file ("public_pneumonia.ipynb"), and you are free to experiment with these ideas and implement them if you so wish. 

This README.md file will be changed soon to include more information about the organization of files in the project.
